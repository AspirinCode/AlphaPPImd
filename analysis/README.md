Euclidean Distance calculation formula is as follows:  

$d(p,q)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(p_i-q_i)^2}$
​



protein contact map represents the distance between all possible amino acid residue pairs of a three-dimensional protein structure using a binary two-dimensional matrix. For two residues 
𝑖{\displaystyle i} and 𝑗{\displaystyle j}, the 𝑖𝑗{\displaystyle ij} element of the matrix is 1 if the two residues are closer than a predetermined threshold, and 0 otherwise.
