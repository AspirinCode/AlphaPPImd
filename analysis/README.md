Euclidean Distance calculation formula is as follows:  

$d(p,q)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(p_i-q_i)^2}$

### Contact Map

protein contact map represents the distance between all possible amino acid residue pairs of a three-dimensional protein structure using a binary two-dimensional matrix. For two residues 
${\displaystyle i}$ and ${\displaystyle j}$, the ${\displaystyle ij}$ element of the matrix is 1 if the two residues are closer than a predetermined threshold, and 0 otherwise.
